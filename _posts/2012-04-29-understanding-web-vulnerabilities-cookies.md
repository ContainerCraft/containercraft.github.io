Last week I gave a presentation on "Web Application Vulnerabilities" as part of our weekly Dev meetup at ThoughtWorks.
The presentation was aimed at covering some vulnerabilities and risks that plague Web based applications,
and to make folks aware of risks and possible mitigation options. In specific, topics covered were Phishing,
Social Engineering, Cookies and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF).

As a continuation to the presentation, I felt that writing a blog on it would crystallize the information
I had collected and make it available to a larger audience.
