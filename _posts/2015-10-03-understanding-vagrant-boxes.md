Vagrant is an awesome tool for developers to get their own sandboxed environments to play with.
To understand more about **Why Vagrant**, you could read my earlier blog post:
[Vagrant: An interesting approach to setup development environments FAST](http://techie-notebook.blogspot.in/2012/12/vagrant-interesting-approach-to-setup.html).
But, because Vagrant does a lot of things auto-magically under the hoods, most of the times people are left confused
when they want to delete or add boxes or VMs. I will try and explain the relationships between Base Boxes, VMs, Virtual Box
Instances, etc in this post.

**Note:** The term *box* is loosely used by many people, and hence the confusion has risen even further.
